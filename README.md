SUMZ-AI-SUMMARIZER is a web application that uses Open AI API to provide article summarization. The user can input the URL of any article and the web app will provide a summary of the article. The summarization is done using the Open AI API, which uses advanced natural language processing techniques to generate a coherent and concise summary of the article.The front-end of the web app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Tailwind, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for styling the app. Redux Toolkit is used for managing the state of the app, making it easier to manage complex data structures and interactions between components.
